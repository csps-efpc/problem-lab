The most important quality a leader possess, regardless of rank or responsibility, is curiosity about how things work beyond superficial knowledge. An eagerness to dive deeper allows breakthroughs in solving complex problems, whether related to work streams or personal endeavors alike. However, the opposite usually prevails among working professionals today - “experts” who believe their vast experience leaves little room for questioning existing processes. 

These individuals feel confident their past experiences qualify them to provide definitive answers without first examining evidence supporting their opinion. Why else would we find numerous cases where proven methods were ignored due to “groupthink”, even while experts provided conflicting recommendations only later proven wrong under scrutiny? Such resistance comes from a mix of pride + fear of looking foolish leading ultimately to poor decision making. But why shouldn’t we see our jobs as experiments anyway? Wouldn’t approaching situations with curiosity lead to asking relevant questions instead of defending current practices mindlessly? Ultimately, treating work as a test lab enables us to discover previously unknown facts providing basis for intelligent choices vs ones guided solely by blind faith in opinions alone. 

So let’s shift expectations toward a goal of uncovering novel solutions via experimentation. After all, how else could a country like Canada maintain its global position as strong player in tech, science & government if not embracing continuous learning thru scientific methodology applied broadly throughout entire society? The alternative of ignoring data driven feedback ensures status quo which no one wants as pathway to mediocrity. The key lies in promoting collective quest for truth coupled with drive necessary for sustained growth - something our nation has excelled at over decades given recent history focused on public investments in education/research.
