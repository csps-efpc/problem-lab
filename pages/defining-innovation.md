In order for any organization to remain successful over time they must be able to change with their environment - both internal & external. They cannot afford to stay stagnant as others will quickly surpass them through natural selection if they fail to evolve to meet challenges that arise every day. To enable this evolution process innovation must become part of your organizational culture. 

You must encourage ideas at all levels so you can adapt & make positive changes that allow your success to continue. Some organizations try to implement programs to foster innovation but unless these are truly baked into the fabric of the company itself the results tend not to stick around long term when leadership changes happen (a frequent occurrence). 

What makes companies like Apple, Amazon, Google etc stand out from peers who once led their industries? These types of businesses have ingrained into themselves processes designed specifically for taking advantage of new ideas across all levels of employee expertise from entry level up to executive & board level positions. This encouragement leads to true & impactful change rather than merely incremental improvements over time. By doing this they keep moving forward, constantly gaining competitive edge as their competition slowly erodes away because they refuse to accept innovation needs to be part of daily corporate life.
