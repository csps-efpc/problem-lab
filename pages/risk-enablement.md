title: Enabling Us To Jump - Risk Enablement

Too often we fear failure more than we value making a difference. We need to give ourselves permission to fail in order to reach great heights. 

As such, organizations should focus on enabling risk and removing barriers preventing progress vs trying to identify ways to reduce risks via red tape. When our actions are constrained by too many rules we end up paralyzed and unable to act. How do we start thinking differently here? Firstly, leaders who want to create teams willing to work together and make decisions free of micro management must build trust within the team before empowering individual members. 

Secondly, clear communication channels and accessibility must exist so anyone can raise potential roadblocks early and discuss them openly without fear of retribution, thus reducing decision fatigue. 

Third, prioritize experimentation over perfectionism. Encourage your employees to launch pilots faster, fail fast, learn quickly and then move ahead towards desired goals based upon those lessons learned. 

Finally, donâ€™t forget how crucial cross training is; having one person own each task limits agility and decreases ability to think critically when issues occur outside typical scope due to silos created within org structure. If everyone shares skills, it breeds better communication, increases resilience & strengthens overall team dynamic.
